# Quickstart

## Installation

We recommend using `pip` to install directly from Github.

```zsh
python3 -m pip install "zap @ git+https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git"  # No PyPSA
```

Alternatively, if you want to install zap with `pypsa` support, then run the following command (instead of the above).

```zsh
python3 -m pip install "zap[pypsa] @ git+https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git"  # With PyPSA
```
