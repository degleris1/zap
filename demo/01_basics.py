        Networks in Zap consist of a `Network` object, which defines the underlying network, and a list of `Device` objects, which are electrical components attached to the network. Devices include generators, loads, transmission lines, batteries, and all other components that connect to the network. Devices can also be used to model financial contracts, such as bids and offers for energy or transmission congestion contracts.

        - Many arguments (capital cost, emissions rates, line slacks, etc.) are optional and introduce additional functionality, e.g., for planning studies.

        ## Solving Dispatch Problems

        Now that we've defined an electricity dispatch problem, let's solve using two different methods.

        1. `cvxpy` - This method will build a model in `cvxpy` and send it to an off-the-shelf solver, such as ECOS or Clarabel. You can also use commerical solvers like Mosek. This approach is best for small to medium problems and finds highly accurate solutions.

        2. `admm` - This method will use a PyTorch implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This can be run on either a CPU or GPU and scales well to larger problems. In general, this method is only capable of finding medium accuracy solutions within a reasonable amount of time.

        ### Solving with CVXPY

        To solve with `cvxpy`, we simply call `net.dispatch` on our devices and (optionally) specify a solver.

        ## Analyzing Results

        Results are packaged into a hierachically structured `DispatchOutcome` object. 

        1. At the top level, a `DispatchOutcome` has several fields: `power`, `angle`, `prices`, and a few others. You can access these fields like any other Python field, e.g., `outcome.power`.
        2. Each field contains either *device-specific information* or *global information*. Device-specific fields will contain a list of length `len(devices)`, where the `i`th entry in the list contains information specific to the `i`th device. Global fields contain a 2d array of size `(num_nodes, time_horizon)`. You can access the information for device `i` using normal indexing, e.g., `outcome.power[i]`.
        3. For device-specific information, each block of information is further broken down by the *terminal* of the device. Many devices, such as generator, loads, and batteries, have just a single terminal and will always be indexed as `outcome.power[i][0]`. Some devices, like transmission lines, have two or more terminals. The data for terminal `j` is stored in `outcome.power[i][j]`.
        4. Finally, the data for terminal `j` of device `i` is just a 2d array of size `(num_devices, time_horizon)`, where `num_devices = devices[i].num_devices` is the number of devices in device group `i`.
