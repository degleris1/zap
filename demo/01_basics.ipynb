Device-specific fields will contain a list of length `len(devices)`, where the `i`th entry in the list contains information specific to the `i`th device. Global fields contain a 2d array of size `(num_nodes, time_horizon)`. You can access the information for device `i` using normal indexing, e.g., `outcome.power[i]`.\n",
    "3. For device-specific information, each block of information is further broken down by the *terminal* of the device. Many devices, such as generator, loads, and batteries, have just a single terminal and will always be indexed as `outcome.power[i][0]`. Some devices, like transmission lines, have two or more terminals. The data for terminal `j` is stored in `outcome.power[i][j]`.\n",
    "4. Finally, the data for terminal `j` of device `i` is just a 2d array of size `(num_devices, time_horizon)`, where `num_devices = devices[i].num_devices` is the number of devices in device group `i`."
