## Documentation

See the [documentation page](https://degleris1.github.io/zap/) for installation, basic usage, and examples.




## Developer Setup

For developers, we recommend installing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
Then clone the repo and install depedencies:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git
cd zap
poetry install --all-extras --with experiment
poetry shell  # Start a shell in a local virtual environment
pre-commit install
```

Then run Python from the subshell.




## Reproducing Experiments

To reproduce experiments from our published work, use the [developer setup](#developer-setup).
Some experiments require a [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) license.
