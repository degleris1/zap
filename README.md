## Documentation

See the [documentation page](https://degleris1.github.io/zap/).


## Installation

We recommend using `pip` to install directly from Github.

```zsh
python3 -m pip install "zap @ git+https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git"  # No PyPSA
```

Dependency on `pypsa` is optional.
This can be installed by running the following command (instead of the above).

```zsh
python3 -m pip install "zap[pypsa] @ git+https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git"  # With PyPSA
```

### Developer Setup

For developers, we recommend installing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
Then clone the repo and install depedencies:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git
cd zap
poetry install --all-extras --with experiment
poetry shell  # Start a shell in a local virtual environment
```

Then run Python from the subshell.




## Basic Usage

Please download the Marimo notebook [here](https://github.com/degleris1/zap/blob/main/demo/01_basics.html).




## Reproducing Experiments

To reproduce experiments from our published work, use the [developer setup](#developer-setup).
Some experiments require a [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) license.
