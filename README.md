## Installation

We recommend using `pip` to install directly from Github.

```zsh
python3 -m pip install "zap[pypsa,mosek] @ git+https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git"
```

In future releases, the `pypsa` and `mosek` dependencies will be actually optional.

### Developer Setup

For developers, we recommend installing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
Then clone the repo and install depedencies:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/degleris1/zap.git
cd zap
poetry install --all-extras --with experiment
poetry shell  # Start a shell in a local virtual environment
```

Then run Python from the subshell.




## Reproducing Experiments

To reproduce experiments from our published work, use the [developer setup](#developer-setup).
